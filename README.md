# COEP-R-in-Probability-and-Statistics

Welcome to this Repository! This repository contains Assignments, code and resources created while learning the R programming language from the basics.
The repository also covers topics in probability distributions, statistics, and hypothesis testing.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have R installed on your system. You can download R from the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/). Additionally, it is recommended to use RStudio, an integrated development environment for R, which can be downloaded from the [RStudio website](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
